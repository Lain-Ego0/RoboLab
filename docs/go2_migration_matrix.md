## Trot parity table

| Concern | Isaac Gym source | mjlab implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Actor observation | `[phase sin/cos, command, delayed IMU, delayed q/dq, action]`, 47 × 10 | one frame-major history term, 470 dimensions |
| Critic observation | command/phase, q-relative, q, dq, action, base velocities, Euler, stance and 4 contacts, 68 × 3 | one frame-major history term, 204 dimensions |
| History reset | zero all frames, then append current frame | custom history term with the same zero-fill behavior |
| Noise | uniform per-field amplitudes, actor only; each noisy frame is retained | noise is applied to the new 47-element frame before it enters history |
| Action | default pose + `0.25 * action`, 1–3 physics-substep lag | shared per-environment physics-substep delay action term |
| Control | explicit PD, Kp 20, Kd 0.5, URDF effort limits | mjlab ideal PD with the same gains and limits |
| Command | uniform ±1, every 5 s; 5% all zero and independent 5% XY zero | custom native command term |
| Reward | 16 source terms, including batch-mean trot gate | same formulas, weights, gates, and dt scaling |
| Reset/termination | q offset ±0.1; fixed root state; base force > 1 N | native reset events and a dedicated base contact term |
| Randomization | friction, base/link mass, COM, gains, motor zero, 4 s velocity overwrite | native startup events and exact overwrite push event |
| PPO | seed 1, 24 steps, 15k iterations, LR 1e-5, 512/256/128 ELU | same supported rsl_rl 5.4.2 settings |

Three source details are not silently claimed as exact:

1. Isaac Gym updates motor/IMU observation latency inside each of four physics
   substeps. mjlab's Observation Manager samples after decimation, so the current
   implementation retains the observation fields but does not yet model this
   substep sensor pipeline. A simulation hook is required before parity can be
   marked complete for latency.
2. The old fork's `sym_loss` PPO option is absent from upstream rsl_rl 5.4.2.
   Its observation/action permutations are recorded in the source config, but a
   compatible augmentation hook remains pending. No old rsl_rl code is vendored.
3. mjlab's public `body_mass` randomizer changes mass without recomputing body
   inertia, while the Isaac Gym source requests inertia recomputation after its
   mass edits. A native mjlab inertia-safe event is still needed for strict
   dynamic parity.

## Jump parity table

| Concern | Isaac Gym source | mjlab implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Actor observation | phase sin/cos, scaled command, delayed angular velocity/Euler, delayed q/dq and action; 47 × 10 | same field order and scaling in a frame-major 470-vector |
| Critic observation | actor-independent state plus friction, a zero-valued `body_mass` buffer, two stance flags and four contacts; 70 × 3 | same 70-field order and source's intentionally zero mass label, 210 dimensions |
| Phase | `episode_length * dt / 1.5`, not wrapped; stance before 0.6 and flight after 0.6 | same unwrapped phase and one-time stance transition |
| Action/control | default pose + `0.25 * action`; episode-sampled 1–3 physics-substep lag; Kp 20/Kd 0.5 | same action mapping, lag range and gains |
| Command | uniform XYZ velocity command every 5 s, 5% all-zero and independent 5% XY-zero | same custom command sampler |
| Rewards | 18 nonzero source terms, including stateful filtered foot air time and gated jump/contact rewards | separate Jump equations and state variables; weights retain source dt scaling |
| Reset/termination | fixed root state, joint offset ±0.1, base force > 1 N, 24 s timeout | same reset ranges and termination threshold |
| Randomization | 256 friction buckets, mass/COM/gain/encoder perturbations, 4 s velocity overwrite | same bucket count/ranges and perturbation schedule |
| PPO | seed 1, 24 steps, 15k iterations, LR 1e-4, 512/256/128 ELU | same supported rsl_rl 5.4.2 settings |

Jump retains the same three cross-backend limitations listed for Trot: the
substep observation-latency hook and old-fork symmetry loss are not available,
and mass edits do not yet reproduce Isaac Gym's `recomputeInertia=True` exactly.

## Rear Stand parity table (Gym source: `go2_handstand`)

| Concern | Isaac Gym source | mjlab implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Actor observation | angular velocity, projected gravity, scaled command, relative q, dq and action; 45 × 1 | identical 45-field order/scaling and uniform per-field noise |
| Critic observation | body linear velocity + the already-noisy actor frame + 34 domain labels + 4 contacts; 86 × 1 | identical concatenation, including the duplicated restitution label |
| Action/control | default pose + `0.25 * action`; 0–3 substep switch delay resampled each policy step; Kp 40/Kd 1 and 90% effort limits | same mapping, delay schedule, gains and effort limits |
| Command | 10 s heading command, X in [-0.2, 0.6], Y zero; 20% all-zero and independent 10% XY-zero | custom sampler and source-specific heading controller with [-1, 1] yaw clipping |
| Rewards | 23 nonzero terms and a persistent batch-mean height gate at 0.70 | same formulas, ordering, weights, gate state and dt scaling |
| Reset/termination | q = default × U(0.5, 1.5), six root velocities in [-0.5, 0.5], base force > 1 N, 20 s timeout | matching reset events and termination threshold |
| Randomization | friction/restitution, mass/COM, gains/encoder, joint friction/damping/armature, 8 s velocity overwrite | matching ranges and privileged labels; native MuJoCo fields where available |
| PPO | seed 1, 24 steps, 15k iterations, LR 1e-3, 512/256/128 ELU; signed observation/action mirror loss with coefficient 1.0 and gradients through both branches | same settings/permutation through rsl_rl's symmetry extension plus a thin source-gradient adapter |

Rear Stand's action latency and PPO mirror loss are implemented. It retains the
mass-inertia limitation above. PhysX restitution has no one-to-one MuJoCo
scalar; its source sample and both critic-label entries are preserved, but
collision restitution dynamics cannot be claimed exact without a validated
`solref`/`solimp` mapping.

## Handstand parity table (Gym source: `go2_leggedstand`)

The source raises `RL_foot` and `RR_foot`, keeps `FL_foot` and `FR_foot` as the
support pair, and targets projected gravity `[1, 0, 0]`. Therefore its migrated
semantic name is Handstand rather than Legged Stand.

| Concern | Isaac Gym source | mjlab implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Actor/critic observation | successful bundled policy/checkpoint uses 48 actor fields: `zeros(2)`, constant-zero `stand_command`, then the later 45-field layout; critic is 3 + 48 + 34 + 4 = 89 | identical 48/89 dimensions, order, scaling, noise and duplicated restitution label; legacy constants retained because they define the trained artifact interface |
| Action/control | default pose + `0.25 * action` + motor zero offset; 0–3 substep switch delay each policy step, with zero `last_actions` after reset; Kp 40/Kd 1 and 90% effort limits | same target sign and delay schedule; reset rows are seeded with a zero-action delay frame rather than backfilled with their first new action |
| Command | every 5 s; X/Yaw in [-0.4, 0.4], Y fixed zero; 20% all-zero and independent 10% XY-zero; no heading control | same effective sampler; unused Gym heading range maps to `None` because mjlab rejects a heading range when heading control is disabled |
| Rewards | 22 nonzero terms in source order; batch-wide height gate uses `mean(exp(-10*error)) > 0.78`, while height reward uses exponent 5 | all 22 source terms retain the same formulas, signs, weights, ordering, stateful two-front-foot air time and dt scaling; the zero-initialized MuJoCo training adaptation below adds three explicit terms |
| Pose/contact semantics | rear feet target 0.67 m and off-ground; front feet alternate support; projected-gravity target `[1, 0, 0]` | same rear/front selection and target orientation |
| Reset/termination | q = default × U(0.5, 1.5), all root velocities in [-0.5, 0.5], base contact > 1 N, 20 s | same reset and termination rules |
| Randomization/push | friction/restitution, masses/COM, gains/encoder, joint friction/damping multipliers and armature; additive velocity push every 8 s | same ranges and labels; dedicated multiplier events and additive push |
| PPO | seed 1, 24 steps, 15k iterations, LR 1e-3, 512/256/128 ELU, `sym_loss=False` | same supported settings with no symmetry extension |

The checked-in Gym source was later changed to 45/86 and explicitly comments
that the three constant fields were deleted. Its bundled `policy_1.pt` and
`model_10600.pt` remain 48/89, proving that the successful training artifact
predates that edit. The migrated task follows the successful artifact contract.

The source config sets observation and command/action latency flags, but
`Go2_Leggedstand.py` never reads those fields. Only its independently implemented
0–3 physics-substep action switch delay is effective and therefore migrated.
The mass-inertia and restitution backend limitations described above still
apply.

### Handstand cross-backend validation

The Gym `model_10600.pt` policy was evaluated directly in both backends with
the recovered 48-field actor contract. It survived 400 policy steps in 128/128
PhysX environments. In MuJoCo it survived about half of randomized environments,
71% with startup domain randomization disabled, and 92% from the exact default
state with startup randomization disabled. This isolates the residual gap to
the PhysX-to-MuJoCo contact/initial-transient change rather than observation or
joint ordering.

Training only the source reward from a random actor converged to the source
task's zero-cost early-termination loophole. The accepted mjlab task therefore
adds an alive reward, a terminal cost, and a dense moving-target curriculum for
projected gravity, rear-foot height, and base height. The moving target reaches
the exact source objective after 400 PPO iterations and its auxiliary reward
fades completely to zero after 600 iterations.

The acceptance run started from seed-1 random network weights with 2048
environments and no resume, load-run, or checkpoint option. At iteration 799,
after 200 iterations with zero curriculum reward, mean episode length was
985/1000 steps, rear-foot height reward was 3.87, and base-height reward was
0.84. Deterministic playback confirmed a four-foot start followed by a stable,
front-foot-supported handstand. The run is stored under
`logs/rsl_rl/go2_handstand/2026-09-07_10-37-41_zero_init_complete_curriculum_2048x800`.

The Gym checkpoint experiment remains diagnostic evidence for backend parity;
it is not used to initialize or accept the mjlab policy.
